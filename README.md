# Pinmap
Pinmap is a pretty simple Android app to pin content about places you've been in a map. It uses [this](https://github.com/mvidalgarcia/pinmap-ws) simple API REST service as a backend.  
Do not expect anything big because it's my first Android app ;)

## Todo

 It needs lots of improvements:  
 * There's a bug in image uploading, the app crashes when it tries to upload big images (> 500K aprox.)
 * The main idea is making it social (multi-user). This way there would be several users who would able to see their friends' maps.
 * User accounts management with Google+. Right now Pinmap is a single-user app.
 * It may be a good idea adding a new section where each user could see statistisc about how many places it has been, percetage of countries visited, travelling frecuency and so on.
 * When multi-user, adding a feed of lastest _pins_ similar to Instagram or Twitter.
